# Gold Foil Experiment

This simulation is based on the experiment performed by Rutherford in 1905 where he planned to test the [plum pudding model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model). He did this by firing a beam of alpha particles at gold foil and detected where the alpha particles were deflected, based on the results Rutherford concluded that structure of atom would contain a dense center (nucleus) and would be mostly empty space.

Because of scaling issues the electromagnetic strength of the nucleus, alpha particle, and electron aren't how they would be in real life as I had to scale it so you could actually see anything taking place, although I used the [inverse square law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) to calculate the force.
